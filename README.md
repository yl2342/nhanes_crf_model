## Nonexercise machine learning models for maximal oxygen uptake prediction in national population surveys



This repository contains the (partial) code and data for the JAMIA paper **Nonexercise machine learning models for maximal oxygen uptake prediction in national population surveys** [paper link](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/30/5/943/7076269). For simplicity, we only provide the code for collecting and preprocessing the data, and training the data with the final chosen LightGBM model. The code for different model comparsion and evaluation is not provided here.

create environment with the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
then activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate nhanes_crf_model
```
